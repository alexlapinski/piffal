Portable Internet Format

A portable internet format designed to encapsulate html, css & javascript into a self contained versioned document.

The goal is to build upon a common compression format (e.g. zip) and distributed version control (such as git).

The end result will be a single file (represented as a compressed folder) which will contain a full version control repository and all supporting assets for the document.


TODO: create piffal editor / reader based on webit, v8 or some other easily extensible platform.
